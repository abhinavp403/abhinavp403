Hi there! My name is Abhinav Prakash and I'm an Android Developer at ReachMobi, Inc. 

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the year 2020 with minors in Economics and Mathematics.

My fields of interest include Mobile Development in Android, Machine Learning, Software Analysis.
The coding languages I am proficient in include Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript.
I've worked on projects ranging from making Android apps, writing scirpts on Machine Learning algorithms, web programming, querying database tables, establishing client/server networks, etc.

In addition to my full-time role, I'm always looking for different ways to hone my skills each day in Android programming. I've worked on apps through internships, in hackathons, class projects, and self-made projects. So far I've published 8 apps, feel free to check them out! (Links provided below)

Besides my passion for technology, I'm an avid sports lover and follow football, tennis, basketball and cricket. I love watching movies and tv shows and listening to music in my free time. I've also delved into the philosphical world and love writing ideas about life, society, individualism. The financial world of stocks and consumer assets is a great interest.
