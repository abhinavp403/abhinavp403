Hi there! My name is Abhinav Prakash and I'm a Software Engineer at Information Resources Group, Inc. 

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst with minors in Economics and Mathematics.

My fields of interest include Mobile Development in Android, Machine Learning, Software Analysis.
The coding languages I am most comfortable in are Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript.
I've worked on projects ranging from making Android apps, writing scirpts on Machine Learning algorithms, web programming, querying database tables, establishing client/server networks, etc.

As a side hustle (hobby), I'm looking forward to hone my skills each day and focus on improving my core Android programming skills. I've worked on apps through internships, in hackathons, class projects, and self-made projects. So far I've published 6 apps, feel free to check them out! (Links provided below)

Besides my passion for technology, I'm an avid sports lover and follow football, tennis, basketball and cricket. I love watching movies and listening to different genres of music. I'm currently working on a psycholgical-thriller movie script as well as have used FL Studio to make a beat or two. I've also delved into the philosphical world and I love writing ideas about life, society, individualism. I'm also looking to explore the financial/ digital marketing world.
